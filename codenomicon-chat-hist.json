      "content": "Sure! We can use the existing code to create a function that calculates the area of a circle. Here's an example:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_circle_area(radius):\n    return math.pi * squared(radius)\n```\n\nIn this code, we have a function called `calculate_circle_area` that takes the `radius` of the circle as input. It then uses the existing `squared` function (which calculates the square of a number) to square the radius, and multiplies it by `math.pi` to get the area of the circle.\n\nYou can call this function by passing the radius of a circle as an argument like `calculate_circle_area(5)`.\n\nNote that we are using `math.pi` from the `math` module for the value of Ï€, which is a more precise approximation of the mathematical constant."

      "content": "Sure! How about a custom trigonometric function that combines sine and cosine? Here's an example implementation in Python:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef custom_trig(x):\n    return math.sin(x) + math.cos(x)\n```\n\nThis function takes an input `x` and returns the sum of the sine and cosine of `x`. You can call this function with any value of `x` to get the corresponding result. Feel free to try it out and see the interesting patterns and values the function generates!"
